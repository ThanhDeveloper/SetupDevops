# Setting up remote access to postgres on digital-ocean droplet via pgAdmin4

This guide assumes you have already set up a digital ocean droplet, if you havent, follow this guide [digital ocean setup instructions](https://github.com/joshborup/Digital-Ocean-setup-instructions)

---

## part 1 - Installing Postgres on your droplet and adding a user and a database

---

### step 1.) Install Postgres

Install Postgres on your Droplet

**double check current version before downloading**

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

### step 2.) Add a user to the database

to add a user to the database, you first need to access the postgres server. you can do that with this command:

```bash
sudo -i -u postgres psql
```

after successfully logging into the postgres server you should see a prompt that looks like this

```postgresql
psql (9.5.16)
Type "help" for help.

postgres=#
```

To add a user to the postgres server type the following,

**you should add the same username as the username you setup when creating the droplet i.e. the one you logged into the droplet with**

**remember to always end SQL statements with a ';'**

```postgresql
CREATE USER josh WITH PASSWORD 'mypassword';
```

if successful you should see:

```postgresql
Output
CREATE ROLE
```

### 3.) Create a Database owned by your user

```postgresql
CREATE DATABASE testdb OWNER josh;
```

if successful you should see:

```postgresql
Output
CREATE DATABASE
```

Now, that we've created a user and database you can exit the postgres console by typing the following and pressing `ENTER`:

```postgresql
\q
```

## Part 2.) Configuring outside access

**Note: The default configurations after installing postgres provide the most security and do not allow remote access to the database, we will add access to only a single outside IP address so as to minimize security risks to our server**

### step 1.) Configuring the server firewall

Typing the following should output the server firewall rules:

```bash
sudo ufw status
```

you should see something like this

```bash
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere
Nginx Full                 ALLOW       Anywhere
OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
Nginx Full (v6)            ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
```

Because postgres runs on port 5432 by default, we will need to allow access to that port in the firewall or the server. It is very insecure to allow access from anywhere as this is direct access to your/user data

Get your outward facing or Public IP address on your local machine, you can get that by opening a new terminal on your local machine and typing:

(hint: `cmd + t` will open another terminal window)

```bash
curl ifconfig.me
```

after getting your IP, go back to the droplet terminal and type:

```bash
sudo ufw allow from public_ip_address to any port 5432
```

Double check the rule was added correctly by typing:

```bash
sudo ufw status
```

The output should look something like this

```bash
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere
Nginx Full                 ALLOW       Anywhere
5432                       ALLOW       public_ip_address
OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
Nginx Full (v6)            ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
```

### Step 2.) Changing postgres congif files

In order to allow access to the postgres server we need to change some of the postgres config files, the 2 files we will change are `postgresql.conf` and `pg_hba.conf`, these files will be located in `/etc/postgresql/9.5/main/`

first

```bash
cd /etc/postgresql/9.5/main
sudo nano pg_hba.conf
```

under the section:

```
# Put your actual configuration here
# ----------------------------------
#
# If you want to allow non-local connections, you need to add more
# "host" records.  In that case you will also need to make PostgreSQL
# listen on a non-local interface via the listen_addresses
# configuration parameter, or via the -i or -h command line switches.
```

You will need to add your `postgres user`, `database`, and `public_ip_address` to this file along with specifying `host` and `md5` so that you keep your password encrypted and access via the postgres server via the the droplet ip address.

it will look like this:

```
host    testdb  josh       public_ip_address/32       md5
```

you can then `ctrl-x` and save the file

next you will need to edit the `postgresql.conf` file by typing

```
sudo nano postgresql.conf
```

find the section that says `listen_addresses` and add the droplet ip address, this will allow the postgres server to be accessible by the droplet ip address and not only `localhost`

```
#listen_addresses = 'localhost'         # what IP address(es) to listen on;
listen_addresses = 'localhost,droplet_ip_address'
```

you can then `ctrl-x` and save the file

finally we need to restard the postgres Daemon for our file changes to take effect

(in computing daemons are just processes that run in the background)

```
sudo systemctl restart postgresql
```

check that the server restarted and is <span style='color:limegreen'>active</span> by typing:

```
sudo systemctl status postgresql
```

## Part 3.) Connecting with pgAdmin

### Step 1.) Download pgAdmin 4

In order to connect to the droplet, you will need to first download pgAdmin 4

you can do so at the following links

[pgAdmin 4 (MacOS)](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/pgadmin-4-macos/)

[pgAdmin 4 (Windows)](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/pgadmin-4-windows/)

### step 2.) Connect to your droplet

after launching pgAdmin, select the Add New Server option

<img src='./add_server.png'/>

Add a name to reference the server by in pgAdmin, this can be anything

<img src='./set_server_name.png'/>

Add your server connection info, make sure to select save password and then to hit save, this should connect you to the postgres server on your droplet
<img src='./add_connection_info.png'/>

Right-Click on your database and select the Query Tool
<img src='./use_query_tool.png'/>

Start querying your Database

## Connection Strings Examples

---

if you need your connection string for something like SQL tabs, it should be constructed like so

`postgres://username@droplet_ip_address:5432/database`

example:

`postgres://josh@droplet_ip_address:5432/testdb`

if you need your connection string for a server file, on the same droplet as your postgres server, you can replace `droplet_ip_address` with `localhost` and add your users password set when creating the postgres user

`postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/database`

example:

`postgres://josh:mypassword@localhost:5432/testdb`

if you need your connection string for a server file on a different droplet than your postgres server, specify the postgres `droplet_ip_address` and add your users password set when creating the postgres user

`postgres://username:password@droplet_ip_address:5432/database`

example:

`postgres://josh:mypassword@droplet_ip_address:5432/testdb`
